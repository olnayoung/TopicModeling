# TopicModeling

* Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA)

Decrease dimension
When new data added, it is hard to update because we have to calculate everything from the start.

* probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (pLSA)

Assume that there are latent concepts which connects the documents and the words.
 
 
* Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)

Get topic from the probability that the word exists in *the topic* and the probability that *the topic* exists in the document.


* Dynamic Topic Model (DTM)

*The Nth topic in year Y* has to be similar with *the Nth topic in year (Y+1)*


* Topic Over Time (TOT)


* Joint Sentiment Topic (JST)


* Author Topic Model (ATM)

Calculate the distribution of topics by authors


* Dirichlet Multinomial Regression (DMR)

Assume that &alpha; can be different due to the meta-data of the document.
