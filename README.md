# TopicModeling
* Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA)

Decrease dimension
When new data added, it is hard to update because we have to calculate everything from the start.
 
 
* Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)

Get topic from the probability that the word exists in *the topic* and the probability that *the topic* exists in the document.


* Dynamic Topic Model (DTM)

*The Nth topic in year Y* has to be similar with *the Nth topic in year (Y+1)*
